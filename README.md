# Face-recognition-based-on-eigenfaces
The repository contains the python jupyter notebook and the report.

In more recent years Face Recognition introduced itself in our lives. We use it almost every
day and sometimes without even noticing anymore. For example, whenever we post something on
Facebook or import a picture inn Appleâ€™s Photo app, the software automatically recognizes the
faces and assigns labels. Also, the newest smartphones have face recognition as the main security
option for accessing the device. In some states, face recognition is even used to reduce crime and
prevent violence in the streets. Since there are so many everyday life uses these software have to
be able to recognize and handle the problems deriving from having different backgrounds, facial
expressions or light conditions. Therefore, face recognition has become a common problem in
Machine Learning, and it has been approached in different ways. One of the simplest techniques
is eigenfaces: it is quite efficient, and it usually generates good results. Face recognition consists
in two main phases: one is about finding the main features of the images and the second step is
the one that classifies the various pictures as belonging to one determined person or another.
